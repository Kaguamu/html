ðŸ“„ HTML Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of small web projects built using pure HTML, created to strengthen my understanding of semantic markup, document structure, and web accessibility.

Each project focuses on core HTML concepts such as:

Semantic tags and layout structure

Headings, paragraphs, and document flow

Forms and input elements

Links, images, lists, and tables

Accessibility best practices

Metadata and SEO-friendly structure

These projects are intentionally kept simple and content-focused to highlight HTML fundamentals without additional styling or interactivity.

ðŸ”§ Tools

HTML5

ðŸŽ¯ Goals

Master foundational HTML elements and best practices

Build accessible, well-structured web pages

Practice clean, semantic markup

Lay a solid foundation for future CSS and JavaScript integration

As I continue learning and growing as a developer, this repository will be updated with new projects that reflect my progress and deeper understanding of HTML
